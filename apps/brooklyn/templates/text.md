First off, why look at the sales data? Well, I've lived in Brooklyn for about 5 years and want to better understand the wave of Gentrification currently washing over Brooklyn. What I expected to see was Bushwick trailing Williamsburg, Clinton Hill following Fort Green and so on. What I found was just how unique each neighborhood is in Brooklyn. While their differences are obvious from walking around, it is incredible that the differences come across in residential property sales data.

The graphs above are based on the NYC Department of Finance data [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/rolling_sales_data.shtml). Below are three 'data vignettes' that demonstrate how to use the visualization above to explore this awesome dataset.

## 1. A Whole New Neighborhood

If you are looking for an interesting real estate graph, Williamsburg and the surrounding neighborhoods are probably one of the first places to look. The area has transformed over the past decade from one of the most affordable places in Brooklyn (~$150 per SqFt) to one of the most expensive (~$625). Once occupied by 'The Three H's' (Hassids, Hispanics and Hipsters), it is becoming an affluent family neighborhood slash shopping area. Lets look at how the types of buildings being sold in Williamsburg and Greenpoint have changed.

</div>

At first glance, these property type graphs tell the story of developers coming in and building lots of condos. From 2004-2012 there is a strong increase in condo sales and a strong decrease in Family Homes. Interestingly, even that begins to give way in 2013 when residential sales begin to take a smaller percentage of total sales, down to 70% from ~90%. This may show a neighborhood becoming a desirable place to live and then shops and restaurants being created to capitalize on the greater density and wealth.

## 2. 2008 Recovery

One trend you will notice throughout the data is the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on Brooklyn, visible in a dip from 2008 to 2011. While some neighborhoods, like Greenpoint, barely let it dent their meteoric climb, others, like Canarsie are only beginning to recover. Lets take a look at two neighborhoods here - Clinton Hill and Canarsie - which both felt the impact of 2008 but had very different recoveries. In the graph below, you can see that up until about 2011, your money would buy you just about the same amount of indoor space in Clinton Hill as in Canarsie.

While, I would love to chart a neighborhood's 'number of mentions in the NYTimes real estate section', it is safe to say Clinton Hill received a tremendous amount of press over the past few years. Due to its classification as a historic neighborhood, the type of units solid in sold in Clinton Hill doesn't change very much. Canarsie is similarly stable. It consistently had the largest percentage of Two Family Homes in all of Brooklyn at around 55% of ALL sales. While neither neighborhood has visually changed all much from 2008 until now, they have had very different paths since. Clinton Hill is over $650 per SqFt while Canarsie is still below peak at around $250.

## 3. Brownstones vs Lofts

Bushwick and Brooklyn Heights could not be more different. Historically, Brooklyn Heights is the wealthiest neighborhood in Brooklyn and it shows. They disguise a vent from the underground subway as a brownstone so that it is more visually consistent. Bushwick is aâ€¦less visually consistent industrial neighborhood that over the past decade or so, has converted into artist studios and lofts. The types of property sold in each neighborhood could not be more different.

<svg id="heights-building-class" class="stacked-area-chart svg-building-class" />
<svg id="bushwick-building-class" class="stacked-area-chart svg-building-class" />
</div>

The building class data is some of the most difficult to compare. This serves as a good example for getting started looking at those graphs.

# Where the data comes from

The raw sales data is on the department of Finance website [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dof/html/property/rolling_sales_data.shtml) and the neighborhood tabulation areas are [here](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwn_nynta.shtml). The raw sales data also includes commercial sales. I chose not to display them here since there are relatively few making it difficult to display a clear trend. There are some caveats with the data. For example, out of 487,874 residential sales only 223,529 were both individual units and had enough information to calculate a sane price per square foot. Even then, the data measuring the actual square footage of a property is the 'Gross Square Feet'. Gross SqFt is defined as 'the total area of all the floors of a building as measured from the exterior surfaces of the outside walls of the building, including the land area and space within any building or structure on the property'. A significant portion of the missing sales do not have a sale price, indicating it was a transfer of ownership 'without a cash consideration' possibly from parent to child. Another excluded portion are residential lots with small structures on them.
