This is a look at 3.x million 311 calls across all 5 boroughs of New York.


## About the data

The 311 data comes from [NYC Open Data](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9) and the population data by NTA comes from [NYC Planning](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/census/demo_tables_2010.shtml). The outlines for neighborhoods also come from [NYC Planning](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwn_nynta.shtml) and in a form New York calls 'Neighborhood Tract Areas' or NTAs for short.

The first thing you may notice is that not that many people call 311. In most neighborhoods, only 1 in 100 people call 311 over the course of a given month (so many 1s!). But, when you think about the density of New York, with many of these neighborhoods housing over 100,000 people, it amounts to a very, very large 311 service. Between 2010 and 2014, over 7,712,843 311 calls were recorded.
